## The "GreenOps" Standard
Every project on this site follows a standardized, production-ready lifecycle:

1. **Strategy & Discovery:** Mapping business personas to measurable impact.
2. **Architecture Vision:** TOGAF-aligned ADM artifacts and C4 models.
3. **Agentic Layer:** Multi-agent system design (LangGraph/Gemini).
4. **Cloud Infrastructure:** Secure, event-driven GCP blueprints via Terraform.
5. **Operations:** SRE-based monitoring and support runbooks.
